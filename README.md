UMWP Autochanger is a little tool for multi-monitors windows users. I has two main features :
* randomly and periodically change the wallpaper of all your monitors,
* manage sets of wallpapers, allowing you to quickly change which images are used.

### Branding
UMWP originally meant **UltraMon Wallpaper**. When I removed UltraMon dependency in version 2 I searched a new name that match with the acronym. And I came with **Ultimate Monitor Wallpaper**, which is very pompous !
