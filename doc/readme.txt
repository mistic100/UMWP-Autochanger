Description :

UMWP Autochanger is a little tool for UltraMon users. I has two main features :
 - randomly and periodically change the wallpaper of all your monitors,
 - manage sets of wallpapers, allowing you to quickly change which images are used.



Installation :

 1. Install and configure UlraMon on your computer.
 
 2. Go to the wallpaper configuration of UltraMon, and configure the "default" wallpaper
    as you wish (you don't need to define an image file).
 
 3. Launch "UMWP Autochanger.exe"?
 
 3*. Depending on your configuration, you might be asked to locate "UltraMonDesktop.exe".
 
 4. Click on "Add" to add a new set. A set is basically a directory containing JPEG/PNG/BMP files.
    UMWP Autochanger will browse this directory recursively up to 3 levels searching for image files.
    
 5. Once you have added you sets, click on "Apply", the wallpaper will randomly change
    every 60 seconds (default delay).
    
    
Troubleshouting :

  Q: When I launch UMWP Autochanger, the window doesn't appear.
  A: When you have registered sets, the window automatically minimize to the system bar,
     double-click on the icon (or right-click => "Show") to open it.
     This behavior can be changed on the "Options" menu.
     
  Q: How can I make UMWP Autochanger starts with Windows ?
  A: Create a shortcut to "UMWP Autochanger.exe" and place it in the startup folder of the program list.
  
  Q: Can I rename a set ?
  A: Yes. Double-click on it's name, you will be asked to enter the new name.
